      "question": "Why do you call it mOSAIC?",
      "answer": "The name 'Mosaic' suggests our approach to investing.

      "question": "Can you introduce the fund briefly?",
      "answer": "Ours is a category-2 fund called multi-yield series 1. It has a 4 year 11 months maturity and is a close-ended fund.

Our portfolios will likely deliver 16% gross yield and in the range of 13-14% net yield to investors. The fund is structured so you can put 25% of the amount in March/April 2025 and the rest will be called in June, September and December 2025."

      "question": "What is performing credit?",
      "answer": "Performing credit is a broad term, often synonymous with structured credit, a subset of the private debt industry. Different fund managers define it in varied ways, but generally, it refers to credit that is not distressed, not a new venture, and does not require a turnaround strategy for repayment. In simpler terms, if the firm we're lending to is expected to return the capital assuming similar conditions persist over the next few years, it's considered performing credit."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of investors is this fund appropriate for?",
      "answer": "This fund is ideal for sophisticated investors seeking fixed-income allocation, particularly those who can commit to an average lock-in period of 3-4 years and don't require immediate liquidity. The fund is designed to accept investments from NRIs as well. It's suitable for investors in tier-2 cities who often invest in unsecured corporate fixed deposits, providing them with a more secure alternative. Additionally, investors looking to rebalance their portfolios in favor of fixed income due to recent weakness in equity markets would benefit from this fund."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there liquidity in this fund?",
      "answer": "This is a close-ended fund. However, we will make our best efforts to assist investors in exiting through secondary sales if needed."

    {
      "question": "How can one make 14% from assets when banks are ready to lend at 9% for home loans?",
      "answer": "Banks can price risks at significantly lower levels, so we avoid competing with them and focus on areas where banks cannot operate. Banks are heavily regulated and cannot offer the repayment flexibility that the bond market can. Our facilities are tailored to match borrowers' cash flows, unlike bank loans with fixed EMI structures. Banks cannot replace equity capital or finance promoters buying out other firms. We can engage in bridge-to-IPO lending with proper collateral. By leveraging regulatory arbitrage and equity substitution, we capture excess risk premium in our loans. We also seek opportunities to finance well-capitalized mid-sized financiers and corporates when available at attractive yields."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much will I net-earn in your fund?",
      "answer": "Our fund aims to deliver approximately 13-14% returns to investors, which is 5-7% above the sovereign rate. This is comparable to equity returns but with significantly lower volatility. Since AIFs are close-ended structures, there is no mark-to-market risk for investors. Even in open-ended credit funds, the 3-year rolling return standard deviation is less than 2%, compared to Nifty's 13%. For reference, Nifty's annual standard deviation is 18%, highlighting the stability of our fund's returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 13-14% an adequate return for this kind of portfolio?",
      "answer": "Yes, 13% net yield is an excellent outcome for performing credit funds. Even distress funds in India, which carry much higher risk, deliver around 15-16% net yield. Most new performing credit fund offerings have a portfolio yield of 13-14% and net yield to investors of 10-11%. We achieve higher returns for our investors by maintaining a very low expense structure. As this is our first fund in the performing credit category, we aim to provide best-in-class returns without taking significant risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this performance after tax?",
      "answer": "Post-tax returns in our fund will likely be close to 10%. This translates to approximately 5% real return (above inflation), comparable to equity returns. However, investors should consult their financial advisors or chartered accountants to understand the specific tax implications applicable to them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a credit fund be brought close to FDs or FMPs?",
      "answer": "Regular payouts to investors, typically 9-10% annually distributed quarterly, provide a similar experience to FDs. However, our fund offers better diversification, resembling mutual funds, unlike the concentrated portfolios of many credit funds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How will my fund be taxed?",
      "answer": "The fund is a pass-through entity, meaning only TDS will be deducted at applicable rates. Investors must discharge their tax liabilities after taking TDS credits. We will provide Form 64C annually and TDS certificates quarterly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of firms will you invest in?",
      "answer": "We invest exclusively in performing firms that meet stringent criteria: manageable leverage, strong coverage ratios, competitive margins, tangible and enforceable collateral, facilities supported by cash flows, and favorable external credit conditions. We avoid firms competing with China, those in significant capex cycles, facing intense competition, or heavily reliant on state government receivables. We also avoid non-bankable assets where banks won't lend. We don't speculate on turnarounds or active change management."
    },
    {
      "question": "How will you diversify your fund across sectors?",
      "answer": "Our portfolio allocation will include: Financials (20-30%) with investments in mid-sized NBFCs yielding 12-14%, Corporate Finance (40-60%) with capital market-related exposures yielding 14-16%, and Developer Finance (about 20%) focused on residential projects in top cities yielding 16-19%. Deal sizes typically range from Rs. 20-25 crore for financials, Rs. 25-40 crore for real estate, and Rs. 20-40 crore for structured finance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is diversification so important in your portfolio?",
      "answer": "Diversification ensures robustness under varying market conditions. Credit portfolios have high intra-sector beta but low inter-sector beta, making diversification more critical than in equities. For example, a commodity collapse in 2015 did not affect NBFCs, and an NBFC crisis in 2018 did not impact commodities or real estate. We aim to provide one of the most diversified funds in the country with 25-30 securities across different sectors, which reduces both company-specific and sector risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is your strategy different from others?",
      "answer": "Our strategy stands out in four key ways: 1) Diversification Across Multiple Sectors - Most industry funds are sectoral, while we bring various uncorrelated assets together; 2) Ability to Originate Transactions Ourselves - Over 50% of our deals are originated in-house, saving 1-2% in investment banking fees; 3) Risk Management - Our experienced team has seen multiple cycles and is exit-focused if things go wrong; 4) Independent, Unconflicted Franchise - We don't run distribution, an NBFC, or other businesses, making our fund management views unconflicted."
